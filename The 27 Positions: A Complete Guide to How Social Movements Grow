# The 27 Positions: A Complete Guide to How Social Movements Grow

## Introduction: Three Questions That Shape Every Movement

Every social movement, from the smallest local campaign to world-changing revolutions, wrestles with three fundamental questions that determine its fate. These aren't abstract concerns but practical challenges that organizers face every day:

**Who are we?** This is the question of identity. Are we disconnected individuals sharing a complaint, or have we become a unified force? Do we speak as workers, as citizens, as humans? The journey from "me" to "we" to "all of us" shapes everything else a movement can accomplish.

**Where do we organize?** This is the question of space. Do we meet in secret, protest in streets, or negotiate in boardrooms? Are we local or global, underground or public, concentrated or distributed? How movements occupy and create space determines their power and reach.

**When do we act?** This is the question of time. Do we strike now or build for later? Are we responding to immediate crises or planning long-term transformation? How do we sustain ourselves through the inevitable cycles of advance and retreat?

These three dimensions create 27 distinct positions that movements can occupy as they evolve. Think of this framework as a diagnostic tool and strategic guide – it helps you understand where your movement stands today and what paths forward are possible. The positions aren't a rigid sequence but a map of possibilities, drawn from decades of movement history and organizing experience.

Understanding these positions can mean the difference between a movement that flares and dies versus one that transforms society. Each position offers lessons learned through struggle, victories earned through sacrifice, and wisdom gained through both failure and success.

## Stage I: Before the Movement
*When anger exists but no one's organized yet*

In Stage I, discontent saturates society but lacks any vehicle for expression. These positions capture the period before a movement properly exists – when frustration simmers privately, erupts chaotically, or circulates endlessly without direction. Understanding this stage helps organizers recognize the raw materials from which movements emerge and the spark needed to ignite them.

### Position 1: The Void
**Nobody organized, nothing happening, nowhere to turn**

The Void represents the darkest moment before dawn – when injustice is widespread but resistance seems impossible. People suffer in isolation, believing they're alone in their anger. There's no organization to join, no protests to attend, no leaders to follow. The system seems unchangeable not because people accept it, but because they see no alternative.

Consider Montgomery, Alabama in the early 1950s. Black residents faced daily humiliation on city buses – forced to pay at the front, exit, and re-enter through the back door, sometimes watching the bus drive away with their fare. They were required to give up seats to white passengers, suffering verbal and physical abuse from drivers. Everyone knew it was wrong. Many seethed with anger. But that anger had no outlet. There were no organized boycotts, no mass meetings, no coordinated resistance. Just thousands of individual people swallowing their rage day after day.

The Void exists in that space between widespread grievance and collective action. Sociologists studying this phenomenon note that even when conditions are objectively terrible, movements don't automatically emerge. The missing ingredient isn't anger – it's organization. People need to know they're not alone, need a way to connect their private frustrations to public action.

This position often lasts far longer than organizers expect. Years, even decades can pass with communities trapped in the Void. Workers may hate their conditions but see no possibility of unionizing. Citizens may despise their government but believe resistance is futile. The Void persists because three elements remain disconnected: consciousness (knowing something is wrong), confidence (believing change is possible), and capacity (having means to act).

Breaking out of the Void requires a catalyst – often a combination of organizing groundwork and triggering events. In Montgomery, it took years of quiet preparation by the Women's Political Council, NAACP youth councils building networks, and finally Rosa Parks's arrest to transform the Void into action. But understanding the Void helps organizers recognize that beneath apparent apathy often lies enormous potential energy, waiting for the right conditions to emerge.

The Void teaches patience and preparation. When organizers encounter communities that seem passive or disconnected, they're often seeing the Void – not indifference but isolation. The task isn't to create anger (it's already there) but to create connection, showing people they're not alone and change is possible.

### Position 2: Random Eruptions  
**Leaderless protests that flare up and disappear**

Random Eruptions mark the first visible breaks in the Void's silence. Suddenly, without warning or apparent organization, crowds flood the streets. A police shooting sparks overnight protests. A government announcement triggers spontaneous demonstrations. Social media posts go viral, calling people to gather, and they do – sometimes in stunning numbers. But as quickly as they appear, they vanish. No one seems to be in charge. No organizations claim responsibility. No follow-up is planned.

These phantom protests have intensified in the digital age. The 2009 Iranian Green Movement saw massive demonstrations coordinated through Twitter and text messages, with no central leadership. Protesters knew when and where to gather but not who was calling the shots or what would happen next. When the government cracked down, the protests dissolved as quickly as they had formed, leaving little organizational infrastructure behind.

What makes these eruptions "random" isn't truly randomness – it's the lack of sustained organization. Bennett and Segerberg's research on "connective action" reveals how digital networks enable mass coordination without formal organizations. People join these protests through personal motivation and social media sharing, creating impressive displays of dissent that nevertheless struggle to sustain themselves.

The pattern repeats globally: a triggering incident, viral spread through networks, mass turnout, then rapid dissipation. These eruptions serve as pressure releases, allowing accumulated frustration to vent. They signal that discontent exists and can be mobilized. But without structure to capture and channel that energy, these protests often leave participants feeling more frustrated than before – they've shown their numbers but achieved little concrete change.

For organizers, Random Eruptions present both opportunity and warning. The opportunity lies in recognizing that people are ready to act – the challenge is providing structure before that energy dissipates. The warning is that without organization, even massive protests can amount to little. The Arab Spring's trajectory in many countries exemplified this: enormous demonstrations toppled governments but, lacking organized alternatives, often led to chaos or restoration of authoritarian rule.

Random Eruptions also reveal the limitations of purely spontaneous resistance. While they can sometimes trigger broader movements (as Tunisia's protests did in 2010), more often they flash and fade, leaving only memories and sometimes increased repression. They demonstrate that anger alone doesn't create change – organization does.

Yet these eruptions serve a purpose in movement ecology. They break the spell of inevitability that systems of oppression depend on. They show that resistance is possible, that others share your anger, that the authorities can be challenged. Even when they fail to create immediate change, they plant seeds in participants' minds, create networks of people who've acted together, and sometimes inspire the deeper organizing that builds real movements.

### Position 3: Underground Buzz
**Rumors and memes cycling through networks**

Underground Buzz represents a peculiar state where resistance exists primarily as communication rather than action. The same complaints, jokes, rumors, and calls for resistance circulate endlessly through informal networks – online forums, encrypted messaging apps, whispered conversations. Memes mocking the powerful go viral, then viral again. Everyone seems to be talking about change, but no one is organizing it.

This position has ancient roots but modern amplification. In authoritarian regimes throughout history, when open dissent meant death, resistance lived in rumor and satire. Soviet-era political jokes, samizdat literature, and Radio Free Europe broadcasts kept dissent alive even when organizing was impossible. Today's version plays out in WhatsApp groups sharing political memes, Twitter threads analyzing injustice, Discord servers planning protests that never materialize.

The Underground Buzz creates what researchers call "hidden transcripts" – the critiques and dreams that oppressed groups share among themselves but can't express publicly. These conversations maintain oppositional consciousness even when action seems impossible. They're rehearsals for resistance, keeping grievances alive and sharp while waiting for opportunities to act.

But the Buzz can also become a trap. The constant circulation of outrage without outlet can create a kind of learned helplessness. People feel they're resisting by sharing memes or adding their voice to online complaints, but nothing changes. The emotional satisfaction of venting substitutes for the harder work of organizing. Activists mistake the echo chamber for impact, confusing circulation with mobilization.

Yet this position serves crucial functions. In repressive contexts where organizing means imprisonment or death, the Underground Buzz maintains networks and consciousness that can activate when conditions change. The jokes and memes create shared language and analysis. The rumors keep authorities nervous and responsive. The circulation of dissent, even without action, prevents total ideological domination.

For organizers, Underground Buzz presents a complex challenge. The energy is there, the networks exist, the consciousness is developed – but breaking through to action requires significant risk and coordination. The transition often requires either a dramatic triggering event that makes inaction unbearable, or patient base-building that slowly converts online networks into offline organization.

The digital age has intensified this position's contradictions. Never before have so many people been able to share their dissent so easily. But the ease of online complaint can actually inhibit real organizing – why risk arrest at a protest when you can feel like you're resisting from your phone? The challenge is converting digital networks into actual power, transforming the Buzz from background noise into organized force.

**Lessons from Stage I:** Before movements emerge, there's always a pre-movement period where discontent seeks expression. The Void shows us that suffering alone doesn't create movements – connection does. Random Eruptions prove that anger can mobilize masses instantly but can't sustain them without structure. Underground Buzz reveals how resistance persists even when action seems impossible, keeping networks and consciousness alive for future activation. Together, these positions map the primordial soup from which movements emerge – all the ingredients are present, waiting for the recipe that transforms them into organized force for change.

## Stage II: The Pieces Are There
*Infrastructure exists but no unified movement yet*

Stage II represents a crucial transitional phase where the elements needed for a movement exist but haven't yet cohered. Old organizations lie dormant, waiting for revival. Cultural memories of past struggles persist. Networks of potential allies operate in isolation. The infrastructure for change is present but not yet activated or connected. Understanding this stage helps organizers recognize and mobilize existing resources rather than building from scratch.

### Position 4: Empty Shells
**Organizations exist but nobody's using them**

Empty Shells are the ghosts of past movements – organizations that once fought and sometimes won, now existing mainly on paper. They have charters, maybe even offices and bank accounts. Their legal recognition remains valid. But their meeting rooms are empty, their membership lists outdated, their campaigns memories. They're institutional zombies, technically alive but functionally dead.

These shells litter the political landscape. Consider the many NAACP chapters in the early 1950s that existed legally but barely functioned, holding occasional ceremonial meetings while their communities suffered daily injustice. Or today's union locals that maintain contracts and collect dues but haven't mobilized members in decades. Environmental organizations founded during the 1970s ecology movement that now exist mainly to receive foundation grants. Community organizations that once packed city hall now struggling to fill a room.

Yet these Empty Shells represent enormous latent capacity. They possess what new movements desperately need: legal standing, institutional memory, resource infrastructure, and legitimacy. When the Montgomery Bus Boycott began, existing organizations like the NAACP and Baptist Ministers Conference provided crucial infrastructure – bank accounts for donations, church buildings for meetings, communication networks for coordination. The shells filled with new life.

Sidney Tarrow's research on protest cycles reveals this pattern repeatedly: movements rise and fall, but they leave behind "residual organizational capacity" that enables future mobilization. The labor movements of the 1930s built unions that, even when dormant, provided infrastructure for the civil rights movement. The anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s created organizations that later powered the climate movement.

The challenge with Empty Shells is revival without capture. Often these organizations are controlled by small groups who've maintained them through the quiet years – sometimes out of genuine commitment, sometimes for personal benefit. They may resist new energy that threatens their control. The organization's bylaws and habits, formed in different times for different struggles, may constrain rather than enable action.

But when successfully reactivated, Empty Shells provide movements with tremendous advantages. They offer legal protection that new organizations lack. Their history provides credibility and continuity. Their infrastructure – however dusty – beats starting from nothing. Most importantly, they connect new struggles to historical memory, showing that resistance has deep roots and previous victories.

For organizers, Empty Shells present a strategic question: revive or build anew? Revival offers speed and resources but requires navigating internal politics and outdated structures. Building fresh allows innovation but takes precious time and resources. Often the answer is both – new formations that draw on old infrastructure while maintaining independence.

### Position 5: Keeping the Memory Alive
**Old slogans and symbols persist without a movement**

In churches across the American South, congregations still sing "We Shall Overcome" decades after the civil rights movement's peak. In Ireland, folk songs about ancient rebellions are performed in pubs where no one plans uprising. In Latin America, Che Guevara's image adorns walls in neighborhoods that haven't seen protests in years. These are movements reduced to cultural memory – their slogans, songs, and symbols persisting long after their organizations dissolved.

This position represents the strange afterlife of social movements. The radical energy that once filled streets now exists only in ritual repetition. Anniversary marches feel more like historical reenactment than living resistance. The songs are sung, the slogans chanted, but without expectation that anything will change. It's movement as museum piece, resistance as nostalgia.

Yet Keeping the Memory Alive serves crucial functions that organizers often overlook. These cultural artifacts maintain what scholars call "oppositional consciousness" – the awareness that current conditions aren't natural or permanent. When "We Shall Overcome" is sung in church, it reminds congregants that their ancestors fought and won, that justice is possible, that resistance is part of their heritage.

During Poland's communist era, the Catholic Church kept alive memories of national independence through religious ceremonies that were actually commemorations of failed uprisings. These rituals maintained Polish identity and resistance culture through decades of suppression. When Solidarity emerged in 1980, it could draw on this preserved cultural memory, using symbols and songs that connected contemporary strikes to centuries of struggle.

The danger in this position is that cultural memory can substitute for actual resistance. People feel they're honoring the struggle by maintaining its symbols while accepting conditions their predecessors would have fought. The rituals become empty, their radical content drained away. Martin Luther King Jr. becomes a sanctified figure whose radical critiques of capitalism and militarism are forgotten, leaving only feel-good quotes about dreams and colorblindness.

But when new struggles emerge, these preserved memories provide powerful resources. The symbols carry emotional weight that new creations lack. The songs bind generations together. The slogans provide tested language for articulating demands. When the Black Lives Matter movement emerged, it could draw on the civil rights movement's cultural repository while updating it for contemporary struggles.

For organizers, this position offers both resources and warnings. The resources are the cultural materials that can quickly create collective identity and emotional mobilization. The warnings are about the gap between cultural performance and political action. The task is often to re-radicalize cultural memory, recovering the militant content that comfortable repetition has obscured.

### Position 6: Something's Wrong
**Everyone senses injustice but can't name it**

This position captures a widespread but undefined discontent – the collective sense that the system is broken without clear analysis of how or why. It's the feeling that pervaded America before Occupy Wall Street gave us "the 99% versus the 1%." It's the anger about corruption that simmered across the Arab world before anyone imagined dictators could fall. It's knowing something's wrong but lacking the language, framework, or target to address it.

Something's Wrong manifests as a persistent unease that cycles through society. Every scandal reinforces it. Every injustice confirms it. Every broken promise deepens it. But without clear analysis or demands, this discontent remains formless. People know they're angry but can't articulate exactly why or what should change. They sense the game is rigged but can't identify the rules or the riggers.

This emotional knowledge often precedes intellectual understanding. Communities feel the effects of systemic problems before they can name them. Workers feel exploitation before understanding capitalism. Communities of color experience structural racism before possessing that vocabulary. The feeling that Something's Wrong is collective consciousness in formation, searching for expression.

The pre-2008 period exemplified this globally. Inequality was skyrocketing, financial speculation was destroying communities, democracy was being hollowed out by corporate power. Millions felt these effects but lacked unifying language or analysis. The financial crisis provided the catalyst, and movements like Occupy provided the framework, transforming vague discontent into focused critique.

But this position can persist for remarkably long periods. The sense that Something's Wrong can become normalized, a background condition of modern life. People adapt to unease, accepting that things are bad without believing they can improve. The media offers countless explanations that obscure rather than clarify – it's immigrants, it's technology, it's moral decline, it's personal failure. Without movements to provide systemic analysis, people remain trapped in frustration.

The transition out of this position requires what Paulo Freire called "conscientization" – the process of developing critical consciousness about one's conditions. This rarely happens spontaneously. It requires education, organization, and often catalyzing events that make the systemic nature of problems undeniable. When movements successfully name what's wrong – "structural racism," "neoliberal capitalism," "patriarchy" – they transform vague discontent into focused resistance.

For organizers, Something's Wrong represents fertile ground. The discontent exists; it needs only framework and direction. But providing that framework requires careful work. Abstract analysis alone won't resonate – it must connect to people's lived experience. The language must be accessible without being simplistic. The targets must be specific enough to fight but systemic enough to matter.

### Position 7: Missing Connections
**Natural allies who haven't found each other**

Across the city, tenants organize against the same landlord without knowing about each other. Workers at different facilities of the same corporation fight similar battles in isolation. Environmental groups, indigenous communities, and labor unions all oppose the same pipeline but never coordinate. These are the Missing Connections – potential allies separated by geography, sector, or simple ignorance of each other's existence.

This position represents one of the most tragic wastes in social movement history. Groups that share interests, face common opponents, and could multiply their power through alliance instead struggle alone. They duplicate efforts, compete for resources, and sometimes even undermine each other unknowingly. The connections that could create a powerful movement remain unmade.

Poland before Solidarity exemplified this perfectly. Workers staged wildcat strikes without coordination. Intellectuals published underground critiques that workers never read. The Catholic Church opposed the regime but avoided alliance with secular dissidents. Each fought alone against a unified opponent. When they finally connected in 1980 – workers providing mass power, intellectuals offering strategy, the Church giving moral authority – they created an unstoppable force.

The barriers to connection are numerous and often intentional. Governments and corporations deliberately fragment opposition, keeping different groups focused on narrow concerns. Geographic separation limits contact. Language and cultural differences impede communication. Professional boundaries discourage solidarity. Sometimes groups don't even know others exist who share their struggle.

But even when groups know about each other, connection often fails to materialize. Competition for funding and recognition creates rivalry instead of alliance. Ideological differences become more important than shared interests. Historical grievances prevent contemporary cooperation. Groups protect their turf rather than building collective power.

The digital age has paradoxically both helped and hindered these connections. Social media makes it easier to discover allies and coordinate action. But it also enables groups to maintain their own echo chambers, speaking past rather than with potential partners. The ease of online connection sometimes substitutes for the harder work of building real relationships and trust.

When connections finally form, the results can be transformative. The 1999 Seattle WTO protests succeeded because previously disconnected groups – environmentalists ("Turtles") and labor unions ("Teamsters") – recognized their common interest in opposing corporate globalization. The coalition was unlikely and unstable, but it changed history.

For organizers, identifying and building Missing Connections is essential work. It requires mapping the political landscape to identify potential allies, understanding the barriers that separate them, and creating spaces and reasons for connection. Often this means starting with small, concrete collaborations that build trust for larger alliances.

### Position 8: Flash Mob Politics
**Instant crowds with no identified leaders**

A hashtag goes viral. Within hours, thousands fill the plaza. The crowd seems to move with one mind, coordinating through smartphones and encrypted messages. Police are overwhelmed by the speed and scale. Media struggles to identify leaders or spokespeople. Then, as suddenly as it formed, the crowd disperses, leaving authorities and observers bewildered. This is Flash Mob Politics – the instantaneous assembly of masses without visible organization.

The 2019 Hong Kong protests perfected this form. Using Telegram and forums, protesters coordinated massive actions without central leadership. "Be Water" became their philosophy – fluid, fast, formless. When police arrived at one location, protesters had already dispersed and reformed elsewhere. The lack of identified leaders made the movement difficult to decapitate, but also difficult to negotiate with or build lasting structures.

This position emerged from digital technology's capacity for instant, massive coordination. Where previous generations needed weeks of meetings and phone trees to organize demonstrations, today's activists can mobilize thousands in hours. The coordination happens through "swarm intelligence" – thousands of individual decisions that create collective action without central command.

The power of Flash Mob Politics lies in its speed and unpredictability. Authorities can't prepare for what they can't predict. The lack of formal organization means no headquarters to raid, no leaders to arrest, no membership lists to monitor. The crowd appears invulnerable because it barely exists as an entity – it's more verb than noun, more process than structure.

But this formlessness is both strength and weakness. Without sustained organization, flash mobs struggle to maintain pressure or achieve concrete demands. They excel at disruption but fail at construction. They can shut down cities but can't build alternatives. The energy dissipates as quickly as it gathered, often leaving participants exhausted and authorities more prepared for the next round.

The scholarly term "connective action" captures this phenomenon – people connect through personal action frames and digital networks rather than collective identity and formal organization. Each participant joins for their own reasons, shares their own content, creates their own meaning. The result can be powerful but incoherent, massive but ephemeral.

For organizers, Flash Mob Politics presents a dilemma. Its energy and scale are attractive, but its lack of structure limits what can be achieved. The challenge is building organization without destroying spontaneity, creating leadership without creating targets, maintaining momentum without burning out. Some movements have managed this evolution – starting as flash mobs but gradually developing more sustainable structures. Others have remained trapped in cycles of mobilization and dispersal.

### Position 9: Solidarity Spreading
**Different struggles starting to support each other**

Something beautiful begins happening: movements stop seeing each other as competition and start recognizing common cause. Environmental activists show up at labor strikes. Racial justice organizers support immigrant rights campaigns. Feminist groups join economic justice protests. Not because anyone mandated it, but because solidarity is becoming contagious.

This organic mutual support differs from formal coalitions. There's no central committee coordinating these connections, no memorandums of understanding, no official alliance. Instead, movements begin recognizing themselves in each other's struggles. They see the same opponents, the same tactics of repression, the same systems of oppression. Solidarity becomes logical, almost inevitable.

The Arab Spring exemplified this contagion. Tunisia's revolution inspired Egypt's activists. Egypt's success emboldened movements in Bahrain, Yemen, Syria. But the solidarity went deeper than inspiration – tactical knowledge spread across borders, protesters adopted each other's symbols, movements provided material support despite facing their own struggles. The contagion then jumped contexts entirely, inspiring Spain's Indignados and Occupy Wall Street.

This spreading solidarity often surprises both participants and observers. Groups with histories of tension discover common ground. Movements separated by geography find themselves connected through struggle. The connections form through practice rather than theory – showing up for each other creates relationships that transcend historical divisions.

Digital networks accelerate this process. Livestreams allow movements to witness each other's struggles in real-time. Hashtags create instant solidarity campaigns. Tactical innovations spread globally within days. The same tear gas canisters, made by the same companies, fired at protesters in Cairo and Oakland, make the connections tangible.

But Solidarity Spreading remains fragile without structure. The connections are often personal rather than institutional, dependent on individual relationships rather than organizational commitments. When movements face repression or exhaustion, solidarity networks can quickly dissolve. The energy dissipates, and groups return to their silos.

Yet even temporary solidarity creates lasting effects. Relationships formed in struggle endure beyond specific campaigns. Tactical knowledge spreads and persists. Most importantly, movements begin to imagine themselves as part of something larger – not isolated struggles but facets of global transformation.

For organizers, nurturing these spreading solidarities requires delicate work. Push too hard for formal alliance and you might kill organic connection. But without some structure, solidarity remains symbolic rather than strategic. The task is creating spaces and practices that deepen natural solidarity while maintaining each movement's autonomy and authenticity.

**Lessons from Stage II:** The infrastructure for movements often exists before movements themselves emerge. Empty Shells provide institutional resources waiting for revival. Cultural memories maintain oppositional consciousness between waves of struggle. Widespread discontent searches for framework and language. Potential allies operate in isolation, missing connections that could multiply their power. Flash mobs demonstrate the possibility of mass coordination without formal organization. Solidarity begins spreading organically across struggles. Together, these positions show that movements rarely start from nothing – they activate, connect, and transform resources that already exist. The challenge is recognizing these resources and catalyzing their convergence into organized force.

## Stage III: Becoming a Movement
*Now there's a "we" – but still learning how to win*

Stage III marks the crucial transition from scattered resistance to actual movement. A collective identity emerges – people stop saying "I" and start saying "we." Organizations form, campaigns launch, victories become possible. But this stage also contains the seeds of potential failure. Many movements peak here and collapse, unable to sustain their initial energy or transform mobilization into lasting change. Understanding these positions helps movements navigate the treacherous path from emergence to establishment.

### Position 10: We Exist!
**A named movement but no plan yet**

The moment of declaration: "We are the Movement for Black Lives." "We are Occupy Wall Street." "We are the Sunrise Movement." After months or years of scattered activity, a name emerges, an identity crystallizes. People who were fighting alone now recognize themselves as part of something larger. The movement exists – but that's about all it has figured out.

This position captures the exhilaration and confusion of movement birth. The energy of finally coming together is palpable. The first mass meetings overflow with enthusiasm. Everyone wants to act, to fight, to change everything immediately. But ask basic questions – What are our demands? What's our strategy? How do we make decisions? – and the room falls silent or erupts in argument.

Many movements stall here, unable to transition from existence to action. They hold endless meetings debating structure and principles. They create elaborate mission statements that no one reads. They fracture over questions they're not ready to answer. The initial energy dissipates as people realize that declaring a movement and building one are vastly different challenges.

The Oakland Commune during Occupy exemplified this dilemma. Thousands gathered, declared themselves a movement, occupied a plaza. The energy was electric, the possibilities seemed endless. But without clear structure or strategy, the commune devolved into endless general assemblies that couldn't agree on basic decisions. The movement existed intensely but briefly, collapsing under the weight of its own indefinition.

Yet this moment of pure existence serves essential purposes. The act of naming creates collective identity. People who were isolated individuals become part of a "we." The declaration itself changes consciousness – participants begin to see themselves as agents of change rather than victims of circumstance. Even without strategy, the movement's existence shifts political dynamics, forcing responses from power structures that previously ignored grievances.

The challenge is maintaining energy while building capacity. The enthusiastic crowds at the first meetings want immediate action, but the movement needs time to develop structure and strategy. Move too slowly and people drift away. Move too quickly and actions fail, demoralizing participants. The balance is delicate and often determines whether movements survive their birth.

Successful movements use this period to establish basic frameworks that enable future action. They create decision-making structures, however imperfect. They identify immediate targets that can provide early victories. They establish communication systems and resource pools. Most importantly, they begin transforming a collection of individuals into a coherent force.

For organizers, We Exist! requires managing contradictions. Celebrate the achievement of existence while acknowledging the work ahead. Channel enthusiasm into concrete tasks while maintaining space for the joy of collective discovery. Build structure without bureaucracy, create leadership without hierarchy. The movements that navigate these tensions successfully proceed to actual impact. Those that don't become footnotes – movements that existed briefly, brilliantly, but ultimately ineffectively.

### Position 11: Lots of Action, No Coordination
**Skilled activists doing their own thing**

The movement erupts into activity. Experienced activists launch campaigns, stage protests, occupy buildings. Every day brings new actions – a banner drop here, a sit-in there, a digital campaign everywhere. The energy is incredible, the skills impressive. But zoom out, and it's chaos. Everyone's fighting their own battle with no coordination, no strategy, no synergy.

This represents the "beautiful chaos" phase of many movements. Occupy camps nationwide exemplified this – each city's occupation developed its own character, tactics, and targets. Oakland focused on port shutdowns, New York on Wall Street accountability, Los Angeles on foreclosure defense. All identified as Occupy, but operated independently, sometimes even contradictorily.

The skills on display can be remarkable. Veterans of previous movements bring sophisticated tactical knowledge. Young activists innovate with digital tools. Artists create powerful propaganda. Direct action groups execute complex operations. The movement appears dynamic and omnipresent. Media struggles to keep up with the constant activity.

But the lack of coordination creates serious problems. Actions compete for attention and resources. Contradictory messages confuse potential supporters. Some tactics alienate constituencies that others are trying to organize. The movement expends enormous energy with minimal strategic impact. It's like a jazz ensemble where everyone's soloing simultaneously – individually impressive but collectively incoherent.

This position often emerges from movements that reject traditional organization, believing hierarchy and structure killed previous struggles. They embrace what activists call "diversity of tactics" without mechanisms for coordination. The result is less symphony than cacophony. Power structures, initially overwhelmed by the chaos, learn to exploit the movement's incoherence, playing factions against each other.

The scholarly term "tactical freeze" describes what happens next – movements become trapped in repeating familiar actions without strategic development. Each group does what it knows, what it's comfortable with, what worked before. But without coordination, these tactics don't build toward victory. The movement appears busy but makes little progress.

Breaking out of this position requires difficult conversations about coordination without control. How can diverse tactics complement rather than contradict? How can autonomous groups share information and resources? How can the movement maintain dynamism while developing coherence? These questions don't have easy answers, and many movements fracture trying to answer them.

Some movements develop innovative solutions – spokescouncil models that coordinate without commanding, digital platforms that enable information sharing without centralization, action frameworks that provide coherence while preserving autonomy. Others evolve toward more traditional structures, accepting some hierarchy as the price of effectiveness.

For organizers, this position presents the challenge of building coordination among people who often chose activism precisely because they reject traditional organization. The task requires demonstrating that structure can enable rather than constrain, that strategy can amplify rather than limit, that coordination can preserve autonomy while multiplying impact.

### Position 12: Building Our Rhythm
**Regular events that strengthen identity**

The movement discovers the power of repetition. Weekly mass meetings. Monthly protests. Annual commemorations. These regular rhythms create predictability in the chaos of struggle. People know when and where to gather. The movement develops its own calendar, its own time, its own heartbeat.

The civil rights movement mastered this position. Wednesday night mass meetings at churches across the South became institutions. People arranged their lives around these gatherings. The meetings served multiple functions – strategic planning, mutual support, cultural reinforcement, skills training. They created continuity between dramatic campaigns, maintaining momentum during quiet periods.

These rhythms do more than schedule – they build culture. Regular gatherings develop their own rituals. Songs emerge that everyone knows. Stories get told and retold, becoming movement mythology. Relationships deepen through repeated contact. What starts as a meeting becomes a community, a family, a home.

The Fridays for Future climate strikes demonstrate contemporary rhythm-building. Every Friday, students strike from school. The regularity makes participation easy – everyone knows when and where. It creates sustained pressure rather than one-off events. It builds identity through repetition – participants become "Friday strikers," part of an ongoing story rather than isolated actions.

Regular rhythms also serve practical functions. They provide predictable spaces for political education, turning raw anger into sophisticated analysis. They create venues for leadership development, allowing new voices to emerge gradually. They maintain organizational infrastructure between peak moments, preventing the dissolution that often follows big campaigns.

But building rhythm requires discipline that many movements struggle to maintain. The initial excitement of weekly meetings gives way to exhaustion. Attendance drops as the novelty wears off. Without clear purpose, regular gatherings become empty rituals, maintaining form without function. The movement must balance consistency with evolution, maintaining rhythms while keeping them fresh and relevant.

Different rhythms serve different purposes. Daily actions maintain intensity but risk burnout. Weekly gatherings build community but require significant commitment. Monthly events are more sustainable but may lose momentum. Annual commemorations maintain memory but might not drive change. Successful movements often layer multiple rhythms, creating a complex temporal structure that serves various needs.

The transition from reactive to rhythmic represents a crucial evolution. Instead of only responding to external events, the movement creates its own temporal structure. It stops being purely defensive and begins building affirmative power. The rhythms become facts on the ground that authorities must acknowledge and respond to.

For organizers, establishing sustainable rhythms requires careful calibration. Too intense and people burn out. Too relaxed and energy dissipates. The rhythms must match the community's capacity while pushing toward growth. They must serve concrete functions while building abstract solidarity. Most importantly, they must evolve with the movement, maintaining consistency without becoming stagnant.

### Position 13: Clear Cause, No Long Game
**Big presence but no strategy for what's next**

The movement has achieved what many never do: clarity and visibility. Everyone knows what you're fighting – "End Police Violence," "Stop the Pipeline," "Fight for $15." The protests are massive. Media coverage is constant. Politicians are responding. You've won the first battle – getting your issue on the agenda. But when someone asks "What's your five-year plan?" the room goes quiet.

The Yellow Vests in France epitomized this position. Their grievance was clear – fuel tax increases that hurt working people. Their presence was undeniable – hundreds of thousands in yellow safety vests blocking roundabouts and marching on Paris. Their impact was immediate – the government rescinded the tax. But then what? The protests continued weekly without clear direction, gradually diminishing as the lack of long-term vision became apparent.

This position reveals a fundamental challenge in movement building: the skills needed to launch a movement differ from those needed to sustain it. Explosive growth often comes from simple, powerful messages that capture widespread frustration. But transformation requires complex strategies that build power over time. Many movements excel at the first but fail at the second.

The Occupy movement globally faced this dilemma. The critique was clear – economic inequality, the 1% versus 99% frame resonated worldwide. The presence was massive – occupations in 900 cities. The impact was real – inequality entered mainstream discourse. But without concrete demands or long-term strategy, the movement struggled to convert protest into policy, presence into power.

The absence of long-term vision creates several problems. Tactical decisions become disconnected from strategic objectives. The movement can't evaluate success or failure beyond immediate visibility. Participants burn out from constant action without clear purpose. Opponents wait out the movement, knowing it lacks staying power. Media coverage shifts from the issue to the movement's confusion.

Some argue this strategic ambiguity is intentional and beneficial – keeping demands open prevents cooptation and maintains broad coalitions. But more often, the lack of long-term vision reflects genuine uncertainty. Movements know what they're against but struggle to articulate what they're for. They can diagnose problems but can't prescribe solutions. They excel at resistance but fail at construction.

Breaking out of this position requires difficult strategic work. What does victory look like? What are intermediate goals toward that vision? What power do we need to build? What institutions must we create or transform? These questions can't be answered in general assemblies or Twitter threads. They require sustained strategic thinking, often by smaller groups with mandate from the broader movement.

The Movement for Black Lives provided one model for evolution. After years of protests following police killings, movement organizations came together to create a comprehensive policy platform. The Vision for Black Lives laid out concrete demands across multiple issue areas, providing the long-term vision the movement previously lacked.

For organizers, this position requires bridging the gap between protest and power. The movement must maintain its militant edge while developing strategic sophistication. It must keep the base mobilized while leadership develops long-term plans. It must balance the democratic desire for full participation with the strategic need for coherent vision.

### Position 14: Peak Without Depth
**Huge mobilization but shallow organization**

This is the movement at its most visible and vulnerable. The protests are enormous – hundreds of thousands, maybe millions in the streets. The whole world is watching. Victory feels inevitable. But beneath the impressive surface lies a fatal weakness: no organizational depth. No structured leadership. No decision-making processes. No capacity to absorb new members. No plan for what comes next.

Occupy Wall Street at its peak exemplified this perfectly. In fall 2011, the movement seemed unstoppable. Occupations in hundreds of cities. Massive marches. Constant media coverage. Mainstream politicians adopting the 99% language. Yet by winter, it had largely collapsed. The general assembly model that enabled initial democracy couldn't handle strategic decisions. The refusal to develop leadership left the movement rudderless. The lack of structure meant no way to integrate the thousands who wanted to help.

This position represents both the zenith and the crisis point of movement development. The mobilization proves that mass support exists. The grievances are validated. The power structure is shaken. But without organizational infrastructure, this people power can't be sustained or strategically deployed. It's like building a skyscraper on sand – impressive until it inevitably collapses.

The problem isn't lack of commitment or courage. Participants often show remarkable dedication, maintaining occupations through police violence and harsh weather. The problem is structural. Without clear decision-making processes, every choice becomes a marathon debate. Without leadership development, the same voices dominate while others drift away. Without institutional memory, lessons aren't learned and mistakes repeat.

Many of history's most dramatic protest waves died at this position. The May 1968 uprising in France brought the country to the brink of revolution – 10 million workers on strike, students occupying universities, de Gaulle fleeing to Germany. But lacking organizational structure to negotiate or govern, the movement dissipated when de Gaulle called elections. The energy was real, the opportunity historic, but the organizational capacity was absent.

The "tyranny of structurelessness" that Jo Freeman identified operates here. The rejection of formal organization doesn't eliminate power dynamics – it just makes them invisible and unaccountable. Informal hierarchies emerge based on personality, experience, or proximity. Decisions get made in side conversations rather than democratic processes. The movement becomes vulnerable to both internal dysfunction and external manipulation.

Some movements recognize this crisis and evolve. The civil rights movement's major campaigns were preceded by months of training, planning, and organization-building. When thousands joined the Montgomery Bus Boycott or Birmingham Campaign, structures existed to coordinate them. Leadership was clear, if contested. Decision-making, while imperfect, was functional.

For organizers, Peak Without Depth presents an urgent challenge: build the plane while flying it. The mass mobilization can't be paused while organization is constructed. The task requires simultaneous action on multiple fronts – maintaining protest momentum while building institutions, keeping the base energized while developing leadership, preserving radical energy while creating functional structures.

### Position 15: Movement DNA
**Shared playbook anyone can use**

The movement achieves something remarkable: a replicable model that spreads organically. Any group anywhere can adopt the tactics, adapt the strategies, embody the culture. The movement's "genetic code" – its core practices, principles, and patterns – becomes transferable technology that others can implement without central control.

The lunch counter sit-ins of the early 1960s exemplified this position. After the first Greensboro sit-in, the tactic spread to 55 cities in 13 states within two months. This wasn't centrally coordinated – local groups saw the model and adapted it to their context. But the spread wasn't random either. The movement had developed clear principles (nonviolent direct action), training processes (workshops on responding to violence), and tactical templates (how to organize a sit-in) that could be replicated.

This DNA includes both concrete practices and cultural elements. Extinction Rebellion created a handbook detailing everything from action planning to arrestee support. But they also developed distinctive aesthetics (the hourglass logo), cultural practices (regenerative culture to prevent burnout), and organizational principles (autonomous but coordinated chapters) that gave coherence to diverse actions worldwide.

Movement DNA enables what scholars call "modular repertoires" – tactical templates that can be deployed across different contexts. The strike, the march, the boycott become standardized tools that movements worldwide can utilize. But DNA goes deeper than tactics. It includes the stories movements tell, the songs they sing, the symbols they carry, the relationships they build.

The creation of movement DNA often happens unconsciously through repetition and selection. Tactics that work get repeated and refined. Practices that build solidarity spread. Over time, a coherent culture emerges. But conscious DNA development accelerates movement growth. The civil rights movement's citizenship schools deliberately taught both literacy and organizing. The Momentum model trains activists in systematic approaches to campaign planning.

This position provides resilience that earlier positions lack. When a movement has clear DNA, it can survive repression of particular leaders or organizations. New groups can emerge carrying the same genetic code. The movement becomes less an organization than an organism – capable of growth, adaptation, and reproduction.

But DNA can also become constraining. Tactics that worked in one context may fail in another. Cultural practices that resonate with some communities may alienate others. The movement must balance coherence with evolution, maintaining core identity while enabling adaptation.

For organizers, developing movement DNA requires extracting lessons from practice and making them transmittable. What made that action successful? Which organizing practices build power? How can we teach what we've learned? This knowledge must be documented and distributed in accessible forms – handbooks, trainings, stories, songs.

**Lessons from Stage III:** The transition from potential to actual movement is treacherous. Many movements announce themselves but never develop strategy (We Exist!). Others generate constant action without coordination, exhausting themselves without impact. Some build sustainable rhythms that maintain momentum between peaks. Too many achieve massive mobilization without organizational depth, leading to spectacular collapse. The successful few develop replicable DNA that enables the movement to spread and survive. This stage reveals that creating a movement is easier than sustaining one, that mobilization without organization is ultimately impotent, and that movements must build institutional depth alongside street power to achieve lasting change.

## Stage IV: Strategic Mastery
*Understanding when to push and when to prepare*

Stage IV represents movements that have survived initial emergence and learned to think strategically about power. They understand that struggle isn't just about mobilization but about timing, leverage, and long-term planning. These movements read the political landscape like experienced navigators, knowing when conditions favor advance and when they require patience. This strategic consciousness separates movements that achieve lasting change from those that burn bright and disappear.

### Position 16: Reading the Moment
**Knowing when conditions are ripe**

The movement develops what organizers call "political weather sense" – the ability to read conditions and recognize opportunities. Like farmers who know when to plant and harvest, these movements understand timing. They monitor opponent weaknesses, track public opinion shifts, sense when allies are ready to move. They know when to strike and, equally important, when to wait.

Poland's Solidarity movement in the 1980s mastered this position. During martial law, when the regime was strong and society exhausted, Solidarity went underground, maintaining networks but avoiding confrontation. They built parallel institutions – underground schools, newspapers, support networks. When the Pope visited in 1987, providing international attention and protection, they re-emerged with massive demonstrations. When the Soviet Union weakened in 1989, they pressed for negotiations. Their victory came not from constant pressure but from knowing when to push and when to preserve strength.

This position requires sophisticated intelligence gathering. Movements develop systems for monitoring political developments, tracking public sentiment, analyzing opponent capacity. They maintain connections across society that serve as early warning systems for both opportunities and threats. Like the civil rights movement's network of churches and organizations that could sense when communities were ready for campaigns.

Reading the Moment also means understanding larger cycles. The civil rights movement recognized that the Cold War created pressure for American racial progress – the Soviet Union used American racism for propaganda, making civil rights a national security issue. Movement leaders explicitly leveraged this dynamic, timing campaigns to maximize international attention and federal pressure on Southern states.

But this position can become a trap. Some movements become so focused on waiting for perfect conditions that they never act. Analysis paralysis sets in. The base grows frustrated with leadership that always counsels patience. The movement must balance strategic patience with maintaining momentum, reading conditions without becoming passive.

The skill involves recognizing different types of moments. There are moments for mass mobilization, when public anger makes large demonstrations possible. Moments for negotiation, when opponents are weakened or divided. Moments for building, when the movement should focus on internal development rather than external confrontation. Moments for alliance, when potential partners are receptive.

Contemporary movements often struggle with this position because social media creates constant pressure for immediate response. Every injustice seems to demand instant action. But strategic movements learn to differentiate between moments that require rapid response and those that reward patient preparation. They develop what the Momentum model calls "trigger events" – predetermined conditions that automatically activate campaigns.

For organizers, Reading the Moment requires building analytical capacity within the movement. This means developing researchers who track political developments, organizers who maintain community connections, strategists who synthesize information into actionable intelligence. It means creating spaces for strategic discussion protected from the urgency of daily struggle.

### Position 17: The Breakthrough Moment
**Strategic action that changes everything**

All the patient preparation culminates in this: the perfectly timed, strategically targeted action that shifts the entire landscape of struggle. This isn't just another protest – it's the intervention that transforms possibility into reality, potential into power. The movement has read the conditions, built its capacity, and now executes the campaign that changes everything.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott exemplified such a breakthrough. The Women's Political Council had prepared for years, waiting for the right case and moment. When Rosa Parks was arrested – a respectable seamstress with unimpeachable character – they recognized their opportunity. The initial one-day boycott was so successful it extended to 381 days. The campaign didn't just desegregate buses; it launched the civil rights movement into national consciousness and revealed Martin Luther King Jr. as a leader.

Gandhi's 1930 Salt March provides another model. After years of building the independence movement, Gandhi needed an action that could unite diverse populations against British rule. The salt tax affected everyone and symbolized colonial exploitation. The march itself was meticulously planned – the route, the timing, the messaging, even Gandhi's appearance were calibrated for maximum impact. When Gandhi picked up salt from the beach, breaking British law, he triggered nationwide civil disobedience that fundamentally shifted the independence struggle.

These breakthrough moments share characteristics. They're simple enough for everyone to understand but profound enough to challenge the system. They create dilemmas for opponents – repression makes them look brutal, but tolerance makes them look weak. They mobilize broad coalitions while maintaining focus. They generate stories and images that spread far beyond immediate participants.

The timing is crucial. Breakthrough moments work because conditions are ready – public consciousness has shifted, opponent weaknesses are exposed, movement capacity is built. The same action attempted earlier might have failed. The strategic genius lies not just in the action itself but in recognizing when conditions make breakthrough possible.

Modern examples include the global climate strikes of September 2019. After Greta Thunberg's solo protest built momentum for a year, the movement called for global action. The timing aligned with the UN Climate Summit, maximizing political pressure. The frame – children striking for their future – was morally unassailable. Millions participated across 150 countries, forcing climate change onto the global agenda in unprecedented ways.

But breakthrough moments can also break movements if poorly executed. If the movement misreads conditions or lacks capacity to sustain momentum, the breakthrough becomes a breakdown. The Occupy movement's initial occupation of Zuccotti Park was a breakthrough that captured global imagination, but without structure to channel that energy, the breakthrough dissipated.

For organizers, creating breakthrough moments requires patient preparation and strategic clarity. What conditions would make breakthrough possible? What action could catalyze broader transformation? What capacity do we need to build first? The breakthrough itself may appear spontaneous, but it's usually the result of meticulous planning and preparation.

### Position 18: The Long Road Map
**Multi-year strategy connecting present to future**

The movement now operates with a strategic horizon extending years into the future. Not just reacting to events or planning the next campaign, but mapping a trajectory from current conditions to long-term transformation. This road map connects immediate actions to ultimate objectives, showing how each campaign builds toward systemic change.

The marriage equality movement in the United States exemplified this strategic thinking. In the 1990s, facing nationwide opposition, movement strategists developed a decades-long plan. First, secure civil unions in friendly states. Use those victories to demonstrate that society doesn't collapse when same-sex couples gain recognition. Build public support through personal stories and relationships. Challenge discriminatory laws in courts while simultaneously shifting public opinion. Move systematically from friendly to swing to hostile states. The 2015 Supreme Court victory wasn't luck – it was the culmination of a carefully executed long-term strategy.

This position requires thinking in multiple timeframes simultaneously. Immediate tactics must serve medium-term campaigns which build toward long-term transformation. The Movement for Black Lives' Vision for Black Lives platform demonstrates this multi-level thinking – immediate demands (end broken windows policing) connect to structural reforms (community control of police) leading toward transformational goals (reparations and economic restructuring).

Long road maps include planned consolidation periods. Movement strategists understand that constant escalation is unsustainable. They plan cycles of expansion and consolidation, knowing when to push forward and when to digest gains. The labor movement's history shows this pattern – periods of militant strikes followed by institution building, creating the foundation for next advances.

This strategic planning must balance ambition with realism. Road maps that are too modest fail to inspire. Those too ambitious lose credibility. The sweet spot maintains hope while acknowledging difficulty. The climate movement's demand for net-zero emissions by 2050 exemplifies this balance – ambitious enough to address the crisis but realistic enough to enable concrete planning.

Road maps also require flexibility. Conditions change, opportunities emerge, setbacks occur. The strategic trajectory must be firm enough to provide direction but flexible enough to adapt. The civil rights movement's road map evolved constantly – the success of sit-ins led to Freedom Rides, which led to Birmingham, each building on previous victories while adapting to new conditions.

For organizers, developing long road maps requires sophisticated strategic capacity. This means bringing together movement veterans who understand historical patterns, analysts who can assess current conditions, and visionaries who can imagine transformation. It requires spaces for long-term thinking protected from daily urgencies. Most challenging, it requires convincing movements focused on immediate injustices to also think in decades.

**Lessons from Stage IV:** Strategic mastery separates movements that achieve lasting change from those that exhaust themselves in constant reaction. Reading the Moment provides the patience and timing that enable breakthrough actions. The Breakthrough Moment itself transforms the landscape of possibility. The Long Road Map ensures that breakthrough leads to sustained transformation rather than momentary victory. Together, these positions show that successful movements think like architects of change – understanding foundations, planning structures, and building systematically toward their vision. This strategic consciousness doesn't guarantee victory, but its absence almost ensures defeat.

## Stage V: Movement of Movements
*Transcending single issues to transform society*

Stage V represents the horizon of movement possibility – when struggles transcend their original boundaries to become part of humanity's larger transformation. Here, movements stop thinking in terms of single issues or isolated campaigns. They recognize themselves as part of an ecosystem of change, connected across time, space, and struggle. These positions are both analytical tools for understanding how transformation happens and practical guides for building toward systemic change.

### Position 19: Ancient Patterns Returning
**Timeless templates of resistance re-emerging**

Certain patterns of struggle repeat across history, appearing whenever oppression meets resistance. David versus Goliath. The people against the tyrant. The lone figure facing down overwhelming force. These aren't just stories but templates that movements unconsciously follow and consciously invoke, drawing power from humanity's collective memory of resistance.

The image of the solitary protester facing tanks appears globally – from Tiananmen Square to Tahrir Square to the protests in Myanmar. This isn't coincidence or copying. It's an archetypal pattern that emerges naturally when human courage confronts mechanized power. The image resonates because it connects to something deep in human consciousness – the recognition that moral force can exceed physical force.

Contemporary movements explicitly invoke these ancient patterns. When civil rights organizers called themselves the "new abolitionists," they weren't just making analogy. They were claiming their place in an eternal struggle for human freedom. When indigenous water protectors at Standing Rock positioned themselves as "defending sacred land," they activated patterns of resistance that predate written history.

These patterns provide what Charles Tilly called "repertoires of contention" – established forms of struggle that movements can adopt and adapt. The strike, the march, the boycott, the occupation all have ancient roots. But it goes deeper than tactics. These patterns carry emotional and spiritual power that transcends their practical utility.

The Exodus narrative exemplifies this power. For enslaved Africans in America, for Jews in European ghettos, for liberation movements worldwide, the story of escape from bondage into freedom provides both tactical template and spiritual sustenance. "Let my people go" echoes across centuries and contexts, each movement adding new meaning while drawing on accumulated power.

Understanding these patterns helps movements position themselves within larger stories. They're not isolated struggles but latest chapters in humanity's long march toward justice. This positioning provides resilience during difficult periods – knowing that others have walked this path and prevailed, that temporary defeat is part of the pattern, that victory often comes to those who endure.

But patterns can also constrain. Movements may follow templates unsuited to their context, fighting yesterday's battles with outdated tactics. The pattern of revolution-leading-to-tyranny haunts radical movements, creating fear of transformation. Movements must learn from patterns without being imprisoned by them.

For organizers, recognizing and invoking these patterns requires historical consciousness and cultural literacy. Which stories resonate with your community? Which patterns of resistance does your opponent fear? How can ancient templates be updated for contemporary struggle? The most powerful movements combine timeless patterns with timely innovation.

### Position 20: Dreams Leading Strategy
**Visions and stories that guide action**

Before plans come dreams. Before strategy comes vision. The most powerful movements run on imagination as much as analysis, inspired by visions of the world they're creating rather than just opposition to the world that exists. These dreams aren't idle fantasy but active forces that shape strategy and sustain struggle.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech didn't outline policy proposals or tactical plans. It painted a picture of transformed America where children of all colors play together, where freedom rings from every mountaintop. This vision did more to advance civil rights than any strategic document. It gave people something to fight for, not just against.

The Green New Deal operates similarly today. Before it was legislation, it was a vision – a future of good jobs, clean air, and justice for all. The dream came first, inspiring activism that made policy possible. Critics who dismiss it as unrealistic miss the point. Dreams don't have to be immediately practical to be powerful. They create the horizon toward which movements march.

These guiding visions often emerge from what Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor calls "prophetic imagination" – the ability to see beyond current constraints to imagine radical alternatives. The Zapatistas imagine "a world where many worlds fit." Climate activists envision regenerative societies that heal rather than harm. These aren't detailed blueprints but compelling dreams that orient action.

Dreams also sustain movements through difficulty. When police violence seems endless, the dream of communities where all people are safe keeps organizers going. When poverty appears permanent, the vision of shared abundance maintains hope. Dreams provide emotional sustenance that analysis alone cannot offer.

But dreams must connect to strategy or they become mere escapism. The most effective movements translate vision into concrete steps. The Poor People's Campaign doesn't just dream of ending poverty – it organizes toward specific policies that move toward that dream. The vision provides direction; strategy provides the path.

Indigenous movements often lead in this integration of dream and strategy. Their visions of returning to right relationship with land aren't nostalgic fantasy but guide concrete campaigns for land back, sovereignty, and environmental protection. The dream of restored indigenous ways of life shapes immediate tactical decisions.

For organizers, cultivating and communicating dreams requires different skills than strategic planning. It requires artists and storytellers alongside analysts and tacticians. It means creating spaces for imagination within movements often consumed by urgent response to injustice. Most importantly, it means taking dreams seriously as political force rather than dismissing them as impractical distraction.

### Position 21: Myths That Sustain
**Deep stories that outlast defeats**

When movements are crushed, when organizations are banned, when leaders are imprisoned or killed, what survives? Often, it's the myths – the deep stories that carry the spirit of resistance through dark times until conditions allow renewal. These myths aren't falsehoods but fundamental narratives that preserve movement consciousness across generations.

During centuries of colonization, indigenous peoples worldwide maintained resistance through stories. Creation myths that establish relationship to land. Hero stories of past resistance. Prophecies of eventual liberation. These narratives, passed through oral tradition when written records were forbidden, kept resistance alive even when resistance seemed impossible.

The African American freedom struggle exemplifies this mythic preservation. Through slavery, when literacy was forbidden and assembly restricted, spirituals carried coded messages and liberation consciousness. "Wade in the Water" provided tactical instruction for escaping slaves while maintaining the myth of divine deliverance. These songs created what Cornel West calls a "subversive memory" that sustained hope through centuries of oppression.

Irish republicans maintained resistance to British rule through eight centuries partly through ballads and stories of past rebellions. Each failed uprising added new martyrs to the mythology. The myth of inevitable eventual victory – "our day will come" – sustained struggle through generations of defeat. When conditions finally enabled successful resistance, the mythology provided ready-made consciousness and identity.

These sustaining myths operate even when movements appear dormant. They circulate in communities, transmitted through culture rather than organization. They maintain oppositional consciousness when oppositional action is impossible. They ensure that when opportunity arrives, the spiritual and psychological foundation for resistance already exists.

But myths can also imprison movements in past patterns. The myth of revolutionary violence may prevent exploration of nonviolent alternatives. The myth of inevitable victory can discourage strategic thinking. Movements must engage critically with their myths, preserving what sustains while updating what constrains.

Contemporary movements consciously create and cultivate myths. The story of Greta Thunberg – a lone child shaming world leaders into action – has become mythic, inspiring millions of young climate activists. The narrative of "Water Protectors" at Standing Rock created a mythic framework that attracted global solidarity. These modern myths serve the same function as ancient ones – sustaining struggle through story.

For organizers, understanding and shaping movement mythology requires cultural work often undervalued in strategy-focused organizing. It means documenting and sharing movement stories. It means creating rituals and commemorations that embed myths in collective memory. It means recognizing that movements need meaning as much as they need methods.

### Position 22: Both/And Strategy
**Fighting the system while working within it**

Mature movements hold contradictions that would tear apart less developed struggles. They sue in courts while denouncing legal systems as illegitimate. They negotiate with authorities while building parallel institutions to replace them. They have revolutionaries and reformists working in conscious coordination rather than mutual sabotage. This isn't confusion – it's strategic sophistication.

The anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa exemplified this position. The African National Congress pursued armed resistance while also engaging in negotiations. They built international diplomatic pressure while organizing underground military cells. They had leaders in exile planning revolution and leaders in prison negotiating transition. What appeared contradictory was actually complementary – each approach strengthened the others.

This both/and strategy reflects understanding that transformation requires multiple forms of pressure. The U.S. civil rights movement combined NAACP legal challenges with SNCC direct action with SCLC mass mobilization. Critics argued these approaches contradicted each other – how can you respect law while breaking it? But the combination created unbearable pressure for change.

Contemporary movements increasingly adopt this sophistication. The Movement for Black Lives includes abolitionists who want to eliminate police and reformists who want to improve them. Rather than fracturing over this difference, many recognize these as complementary pressures. Abolitionists shift the horizon of possibility while reformists secure immediate harm reduction.

The labor movement has long operated this way – striking to shut down production while simultaneously negotiating for contracts. The strike creates pressure that makes negotiation possible. The negotiation provides a resolution that makes strikes sustainable. Neither alone would succeed; together they build power.

This position requires high levels of trust and communication within movements. Different wings must understand their roles in the larger strategy. The street protesters must trust that insider negotiators won't sell out. The negotiators must trust that protesters won't undermine delicate discussions. This trust often takes years to build and seconds to destroy.

Mark and Paul Engler's framework of "momentum-driven organizing" explicitly advocates this hybrid approach – combining structure-based organizing that builds lasting institutions with momentum-based protests that create crisis and opportunity. Neither is sufficient alone; together they create transformation.

For organizers, building both/and capacity requires managing egos and ideologies that push toward purism. It means creating spaces where different strategic approaches can be discussed as complementary rather than competitive. It means developing movement-wide strategy that assigns roles based on capacity rather than allowing strategies to emerge from uncoordinated competition.

### Position 23: Connecting the Dots
**Seeing how all struggles connect**

At this position, movements stop seeing themselves as isolated campaigns and recognize the connections linking all struggles for justice. Environmental racism connects climate activists to racial justice organizers. Labor exploitation links worker movements to immigrant rights campaigns. The same systems of oppression manifest differently across communities, but they're the same systems.

The concept of intersectionality, developed by Kimberlé Crenshaw and other Black feminists, provided intellectual framework for what movements were discovering through practice – that oppressions interconnect and therefore so must resistance. A Black woman faces not racism plus sexism but a particular experience that requires integrated analysis and action.

The 1999 Seattle WTO protests marked a breakthrough in connecting dots. Environmentalists ("Turtles") recognized that corporate globalization drove ecological destruction. Labor unions ("Teamsters") saw how free trade undermined worker power. Indigenous groups connected trade agreements to land theft. These connections weren't just analytical but practical – groups that had historically fought each other marched together.

Today's movements increasingly operate from connected analysis. The Green New Deal explicitly links climate action to economic justice to racial equity. The Poor People's Campaign addresses poverty, racism, militarism, and ecological destruction as interlocking evils requiring integrated response. These aren't coalitions of convenience but recognition of fundamental connection.

This connecting of struggles happens globally too. When George Floyd was murdered, protests erupted worldwide because people recognized their own police violence in America's. When Indian farmers protested corporate agriculture, farmers globally recognized their shared struggle. The dots being connected span both issues and geography.

But connection remains challenging. Groups have different cultures, priorities, and strategies. Resource competition creates tension. Historical conflicts leave residual distrust. The urgent needs of particular communities can seem more important than abstract solidarity. Connecting dots requires constant work to maintain relationship across difference.

When successful, connected movements achieve what isolated campaigns cannot. The movement of movements becomes greater than its parts. Opponents who could defeat individual struggles face united opposition. Victories in one area strengthen movements in others. Knowledge and resources flow across traditional boundaries.

For organizers, connecting dots requires both analytical and relational work. The analytical work involves mapping systems of oppression to reveal connection points. The relational work involves building trust across communities through patient relationship-building and concrete solidarity. Both are necessary for connection to become more than rhetoric.

### Position 24: Ecosystem of Change
**Multiple campaigns reinforcing each other**

Beyond simple alliance, movements at this position operate as integrated ecosystems where diverse campaigns play distinct but interdependent roles. Like a forest where different species create conditions for mutual flourishing, movement ecosystems include actors with varied approaches who together create comprehensive change.

The U.S. civil rights movement functioned as such an ecosystem. The NAACP pursued legal challenges that established precedents. SCLC organized mass demonstrations that captured public attention. SNCC conducted direct actions that created crisis. The Urban League provided services and economic development. Black churches offered meeting space and moral authority. Each organization had its niche, and together they created an ecosystem that transformed America.

Today's climate movement operates similarly. Extinction Rebellion creates disruption through dramatic protests. 350.org builds pipeline resistance and divestment campaigns. Sunrise Movement mobilizes youth and electoral pressure. Indigenous groups protect land and water. Scientists provide research and credibility. Together they create a movement ecosystem that no single organization could achieve.

These ecosystems develop organically as movements recognize their interdependence. The group shutting down streets makes the moderate policy organization seem reasonable by comparison. The service providers build community trust that enables mobilization. The researchers provide ammunition for organizers. The cultural workers create narrative that gives meaning to struggle.

Healthy movement ecosystems maintain diversity while preventing destructive competition. Different groups occupy different niches rather than competing for the same space. Resources flow to where they're most needed rather than hoarding by individual organizations. Information and lessons spread quickly through network connections.

This ecosystem thinking transforms how movements understand success and failure. A single campaign's defeat might still advance the ecosystem by teaching lessons or shifting conditions. Organizations can play supporting roles in others' victories rather than needing to claim credit. The ecosystem's health matters more than any individual organization's prominence.

But ecosystems can also become dysfunctional. When resources are scarce, cooperation can collapse into competition. Ideological differences can create predation rather than symbiosis. Without conscious cultivation, movement ecosystems can become movement battlegrounds.

Paul Hawken's concept of the "blessed unrest" – millions of organizations working for justice and sustainability – describes this ecosystem at global scale. No central coordination exists, yet patterns emerge. Solutions developed in one context spread to others. The ecosystem exhibits intelligence without central brain.

For organizers, nurturing movement ecosystems requires thinking beyond individual organizations or campaigns. It means creating spaces for cross-pollination – conferences, coalitions, shared actions. It means developing resource strategies that sustain the whole ecosystem, not just successful parts. It means celebrating diversity of approaches rather than enforcing conformity.

### Position 25: Learning Between Waves
**Knowledge passed between movements**

Movements rise and fall in waves, but wisdom can accumulate across cycles if mechanisms exist for transmission. This position represents the conscious creation of learning infrastructure that captures lessons from one wave and transmits them to the next, preventing each generation from starting from zero.

The Highlander Folk School (now Highlander Research and Education Center) exemplifies this position. Founded in 1932 for labor organizing, it trained civil rights leaders in the 1950s and 60s, supported Appalachian mining struggles in the 1970s, and continues preparing organizers today. Rosa Parks attended Highlander before the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The citizenship schools that registered voters across the South originated there.

These learning institutions serve multiple functions. They provide physical space where movements can gather away from immediate struggle. They offer time for reflection and analysis that daily organizing doesn't allow. They create relationships across movements that enable knowledge transfer. They develop and test new methodologies that movements can adopt.

Contemporary versions include the various "Momentum" trainings that bring together organizers from different movements to study what creates social change. Participants from immigrant rights, climate justice, and gun violence prevention movements share experiences and extract common lessons. The training becomes a site of knowledge transmission both between current movements and from historical struggles.

This learning transmission also happens through documentation. The Beautiful Trouble project compiles tactics and principles from movements worldwide into accessible toolkits. The Global Nonviolent Action Database archives thousands of campaigns, making their lessons available to future organizers. These resources ensure that movement knowledge isn't lost when movements decline.

But effective transmission requires more than information transfer. The deepest movement knowledge is embodied – how to run a meeting, read a crowd, sense an opportunity. This knowledge transmits through mentorship and apprenticeship. Veterans who've lived through multiple movement cycles become repositories of wisdom that no manual can capture.

The challenge is creating transmission during movement peaks when urgency overwhelms reflection. Movements in full mobilization rarely pause to document lessons or train successors. By the time they decline, participants scatter and lessons dissipate. The most effective movements build learning infrastructure during struggle, not after.

Different movements have different learning needs. Some need tactical innovation, others strategic sophistication, still others cultural transformation. The learning infrastructure must be diverse enough to serve varied needs while maintaining enough coherence to enable cross-pollination.

For organizers, building learning infrastructure requires long-term thinking that movements in crisis often can't afford. It means documenting not just victories but failures and their lessons. It means creating mentorship programs that transmit embodied knowledge. It means building institutions that outlast individual movement cycles, maintaining continuity across waves of struggle.

### Position 26: Creating New Battlegrounds
**Inventing new arenas for struggle**

When existing political terrain favors opponents, sophisticated movements don't just fight harder – they create entirely new battlegrounds where different rules apply. They invent new frameworks, institutions, and spaces for contestation that reshape what political struggle means.

The concept of "Just Transition" exemplifies this position. Labor unions and environmental groups had fought for decades, with corporations playing them against each other – jobs versus environment. The Just Transition framework created new terrain where workers and environmentalists unite for transformation that protects both livelihoods and ecosystems. This wasn't just alliance but invention of new political space.

The creation of the International Criminal Court represented movements inventing new institutional terrain for human rights struggles. When national courts failed to deliver justice for mass atrocities, movements didn't just protest harder – they built new international legal architecture. They created battlefield where different rules and possibilities exist.

Indigenous movements globally have pioneered this approach through asserting indigenous law and sovereignty. Rather than only fighting within colonial legal systems, they assert alternative legal frameworks based on indigenous governance. They create tribal courts, indigenous protected areas, and traditional governance structures that operate according to different principles.

The solidarity economy movement doesn't just protest capitalism but builds alternative economic institutions – cooperatives, community land trusts, mutual aid networks, time banks. These create new economic terrain where different rules apply. They demonstrate alternatives while building power outside conventional economic structures.

Creating new battlegrounds requires tremendous creativity and resources. Movements must imagine alternatives that don't yet exist. They must build institutions without existing templates. They must convince people to engage on unfamiliar terrain. They must defend new spaces against attempts to eliminate or co-opt them.

But new battlegrounds can shift dynamics fundamentally. When movements create their own media platforms, they escape corporate media filters. When they establish alternative governance structures, they demonstrate capacity beyond protest. When they invent new frameworks for understanding problems, they reshape entire debates.

The Zapatistas in Chiapas created autonomous municipalities that operate outside Mexican state structure. These aren't just protests against bad government but functioning alternatives that provide education, healthcare, and justice according to indigenous principles. They've created new terrain where indigenous communities exercise power.

For organizers, creating new battlegrounds requires thinking beyond existing institutions and frameworks. What spaces would allow our movement to exercise power we currently lack? What institutions could we build that embody our values? What frameworks could redefine the terms of struggle? This requires imagination and audacity to attempt what hasn't been tried.

### Position 27: Worldwide Web of Change
**Global movement that adapts and endures**

This final position represents the horizon of movement possibility – struggles worldwide connected in a web of mutual support and learning, adapted to local contexts while coordinated globally, creating alternatives while transforming existing systems. It's not one movement but a movement of movements, evolving like a living organism toward justice.

Glimpses of this web appear regularly. When George Floyd's murder triggered protests globally, it wasn't just solidarity but recognition of shared struggle against police violence. When Greta Thunberg's school strike inspired millions of youth worldwide, it revealed global movement capacity that transcends borders. When farmers in India protest corporate agriculture, farmers in Europe and America recognize their shared fight and offer support.

This worldwide web operates through multiple connection types. Digital networks enable instant communication and coordination. Migrant communities create living bridges between struggles. International NGOs and unions provide institutional infrastructure. Social forums create spaces for face-to-face strategy development. Together these create dense networks of connection that approach global movement capacity.

But this isn't centralized coordination. Like the internet itself, the worldwide web of change operates through distributed networks with no central control. Local nodes maintain autonomy while participating in larger patterns. Information and inspiration flow in all directions. Innovation anywhere becomes possibility everywhere.

The climate movement increasingly embodies this position. Local groups fighting fossil fuel projects connect through global networks. Tactics developed in one context spread rapidly to others. Victories anywhere strengthen movements everywhere. The movement operates simultaneously at local and global scales, adapted to specific contexts while coordinated toward common goals.

This web exhibits emergent intelligence – solving problems through distributed collaboration rather than central planning. When one part faces repression, others provide support. When one discovers effective tactics, others rapidly adopt them. The web as a whole learns and adapts faster than any individual part could.

Indigenous movements pioneering this approach through networks like the Indigenous Environmental Network that connect land defenders globally while maintaining distinct cultural identities and local autonomy. They demonstrate unity without uniformity, coordination without control.

The web's resilience comes from its redundancy and diversity. No single node is essential. Multiple pathways exist for every connection. Different approaches to similar problems create innovation through variation. The web can suffer damage without collapse, reconstituting itself around blockages.

For organizers, building toward this worldwide web requires both local depth and global vision. Movements must be deeply rooted in specific communities while connected to global networks. They need strong local identity while recognizing themselves as part of planetary transformation. They must build alternatives where they are while supporting struggles everywhere.

**Lessons from Stage V:** The most transformative movements transcend their original boundaries to become part of humanity's larger evolution toward justice. They tap ancient patterns while creating new possibilities. They operate through both/and strategies that hold contradictions productively. They recognize connections across struggles and build ecosystems of change. They transmit wisdom across generations and create new terrain for contestation. Ultimately, they contribute to an emerging worldwide web of change that may be humanity's immune response to systemic crisis. These positions aren't endpoints but horizons – directions to build toward rather than destinations to reach. They show that movements aren't just political phenomena but expressions of human evolution, ways we collectively learn and grow toward justice.

## Conclusion: The Dance of Change

Social movements are humanity's way of evolving – how we collectively recognize that current systems aren't working and create alternatives. The 27 positions mapped here reveal patterns in this eternal dance between what is and what could be, between oppression and liberation, between the world we inherited and the world we're creating.

This framework emerged from studying how movements actually develop rather than how we wish they would. It recognizes that transformation isn't linear but cyclical, not predictable but patterned, not controllable but learnable. Each position represents hard-won wisdom from movements that succeeded and failed, advanced and retreated, transformed and were transformed.

### The Three Dimensions Revisited

The journey through these positions reveals deeper truths about each dimension:

**Identity** isn't just about who's in the movement but about consciousness itself. The evolution from "me" to "we" to "all of us" represents expanding circles of solidarity and recognition. Movements begin with isolated individuals, create collective identity, and ultimately contribute to human identity evolving toward justice.

**Space** isn't just about where movements operate but how they reshape political terrain itself. The progression from hidden to public to everywhere represents movements claiming their right to exist, demanding recognition, and ultimately creating new spaces for human possibility.

**Time** isn't just about when movements act but how they relate to history and future. The development from reactive to strategic to cyclical represents movements learning to read conditions, plan transformation, and sustain struggle across generations.

### Practical Applications

For organizers and activists, this framework offers multiple tools:

**Diagnostic Tool:** Where is your movement now? Which position best describes your current reality? What are your strengths and vulnerabilities at this position? What patterns from other movements at this position apply to yours?

**Strategic Planning:** What positions might you move toward? What capacities do you need to build? What transitions have other movements managed successfully? What pitfalls should you avoid?

**Coalition Building:** Where are potential allies positioned? How might different positions complement each other? What connections could multiply power? What differences need bridging?

**Historical Learning:** What can you learn from movements that navigated similar positions? What patterns repeat across contexts? What innovations might apply to your situation?

**Resource Allocation:** What does your current position require? Are you investing in the right capacities? Are you preparing for what's next?

### Common Patterns and Warnings

Studying these positions reveals recurring patterns that movements should understand:

**The Mobilization Trap:** Many movements achieve massive mobilization (Position 14) but lack the organizational depth to sustain it. Building structure during peak mobilization is nearly impossible – it must be developed beforehand or the moment will be lost.

**The Rhythm Revolution:** Movements that establish sustainable rhythms (Position 12) outlast those that rely on constant crisis. Regular patterns of gathering, action, and reflection create the consistency needed for long-term struggle.

**The Strategic Evolution:** Movements that develop strategic consciousness (Stage IV) achieve more than those with better resources but less strategy. Reading conditions, timing interventions, and planning trajectories matter more than raw people power.

**The Connection Imperative:** Isolated movements rarely win systemic change. Those that connect across issues, communities, and struggles (Stage V) build the power necessary for transformation.

**The Learning Legacy:** Movements that document lessons and transmit knowledge enable future struggles. Those that don't condemn the next generation to repeat their mistakes.

### The Dialectical Dance

Throughout these positions, we see three fundamental tensions that drive movement evolution:

**Autonomy versus Unity:** Movements must balance individual initiative with collective discipline, diverse tactics with coherent strategy, local adaptation with global coordination. Neither pure autonomy nor rigid unity works – the dance between them creates power.

**Patience versus Urgency:** Movements must respond to immediate injustice while building long-term power, react to crises while maintaining strategy, act when conditions demand while waiting when preparation requires. Knowing when to push and when to prepare separates successful movements from exhausted ones.

**Reform versus Revolution:** Movements must win immediate improvements while pursuing systemic transformation, work within existing systems while building alternatives, negotiate with power while building power. The both/and approach that holds these tensions productively achieves more than purist approaches.

### Beyond Single Movements

The framework ultimately points beyond individual movements toward the movement of movements – the recognition that isolated struggles for particular issues or communities cannot achieve the transformation our times require. Climate change, inequality, authoritarianism, and other crises are interconnected symptoms of systemic failure that require coordinated response.

The 27 positions show how movements can evolve from isolated anger to connected action, from single-issue campaigns to systemic transformation, from local struggles to global movements. They map not just how individual movements develop but how movements together might create the worldwide web of change needed for humanity's next evolution.

### The Work Ahead

If this framework reveals anything, it's that movements aren't events but processes, not moments but journeys, not explosions but evolutions. Creating change isn't about finding the right tactic or perfect moment but about building through stages, learning from patterns, connecting across difference, and sustaining struggle through cycles.

Whether you're in the Void of disconnection, riding the peak of mobilization, or building toward global transformation, the map shows you're not alone and not the first. Others have walked this path and left lessons. Others are walking it now and need solidarity. Others will walk it after and need the trails you blaze.

The question isn't whether change is possible – the framework shows it happening constantly. The question is whether we'll learn from patterns to accelerate transformation, connect across struggles to multiply power, and sustain movements through the long dance of change.

Every position offers lessons. Every transition teaches something essential. Every movement contributes to humanity's collective learning about how to create justice. The dance continues, and we all have parts to play.

Where is your movement today, and where will you help it go tomorrow?
